# BoolGrad

Implement a Backprop Algo on computational graph consisting of Boolean variables.
It is a Proof-of-Concept implementation of key concepts introduced in the paper [BOLD: Boolean Logic Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16339).


The code structure ad organization is heavily inspired from [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) by Andrej Karpathy. It is almost a copy with necessary changes for dealing with Boolean values.

For implications, see this [notes](https://mlsquare.github.io/intro2dl/lectures/L01.html#universal-approximation)
